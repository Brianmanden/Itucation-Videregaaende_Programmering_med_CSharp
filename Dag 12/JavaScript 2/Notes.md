--- Exercise 1 ---
Create a webpage with two inputs and a button. Tell the user that the inputs are meant to be used with numbers.
(If you would rather find a way to use prompts instead of inputs that's okay as well)
When the button is clicked, use javascript to:
 - Grab two numbers from your two inputs in your browser.
 - Add them together, and display the result.


--- Exercise 2 ---
Using a new brand new site, or your work from yesterday, use javascript to add some fun functionality to your website.
You decide exactly how much fun to include, as long as you use at least one user defined function in the process.


--- Exercise 3 ---
Find an image of your own choice, and add it to your project.
Create an html-page, and add the image to it.
Add two simple paragraphs with some text as well.
Find a way to add jQuery to your project, and add it to your html page.


--- Exercise 4 ---
Using jQuery, add some fun functionality to your webpage:
 - Hide your image by clicking on it.
 - Get your image to show again by clicking on a button.
 - When clicking on one of the paragraphs, change the text of the other paragraph.
