# --- Exercise 1 ---

In this exercise you can use either our DatabaseFirst project from today OR the DropDownDemo (Streaming Services).

Run the project and go through the different Views.

Take note of all the places where the displayed names/values of different properties don't seem appropriate.

For example, "pName" isn't as human-readable as compared to "Product".

Or: StreamingServiceID is not as easy to interpret as the name of the streaming service.

Find a way to change what's displayed to be more user friendly.


# --- Exercise 2 ---
With your old Employees and Departments tables in VoresDB, create a new Web App using the database first approach.
