---- Exercise 1 ----
Create an index.html file, and start working on your very own webpage.
Make the index page tell everyone who visits a little about what's on the page.

---- Exercise 2 ----
Create at least 2 other .html pages, and make sure you can navigate between your pages.
Make your webpages have a consistent topic. Maybe you want to show us different animals?
In that case, have the index guide you to different sub pages with dogs/cats/etc.
You decide exactly what you want to show.


---- Exercise 3 ----
Have fun styling your pages with a .css document!
Fun was had ;)
