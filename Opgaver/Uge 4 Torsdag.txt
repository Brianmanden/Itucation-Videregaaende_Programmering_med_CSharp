--- Exercise: WebAPI ---
In today's exercise, you are going to create an API to use with one of your hobbies.
You can use either a database or just create your own data in a repository.

Start by creating your Model.

Create an Interface and add methods to Get, Create, Update, and Delete.
Create a Repository which implements your interface.
Add Dependency Injection to your Program file.

Now it is time to create a controller for your hobby.
Make sure your controller makes use of your repository.
Your controller should have endpoints to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.

Run your app, and test your endpoints using Postman!
